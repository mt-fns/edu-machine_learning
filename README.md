This a simple machine learning project to predict student's grades.
The project is ready to use. All you need to do is do is upload a .csv file that contains the studentsâ€™ past grades. 

# Info
I'm using two grades for the training data. You can modify the codes to use as many grades as you want.
You need to format your file before uploading it. Make sure to place the 1st and 2nd grade in the last two columns of your file.

**Note:** The accuracy of the prediction depends heavily on the training data you provide.
